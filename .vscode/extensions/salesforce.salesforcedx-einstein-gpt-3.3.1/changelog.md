## 3.3.1

## Fixed

- We fixed some security issues under the hood.

# 3.3.0

## Added

- We introduced `/deep-planning`, a four-step planning flow that scans your codebase, clarifies requirements, generates an implementation plan, and launches a new task pre-loaded with all necessary context.
- We introduced `Focus Chain`, which maintains a live todo list and tracks progress throughout long tasks. This helps Agentforce manage context across resets and remain focused on multi-step workflows.
- We updated the auto-approve toggle behavior so it no longer triggers MCP server reconnections. This eliminates related race conditions and unnecessary UI re-renders, improving responsiveness and reducing delay.
- We made some updates to the MCP server Enable/Disable UX.

# 3.2.0

## Added

- We added support for user-defined safe terminal commands. Safe commands run automatically, with approval prompts for potentially unsafe cases.

## Fixed

- We fixed an issue where fallback requests were not routed through the topic classifier check on the server side.
- We fixed a bug where default rules were not restored on extension reinstall. As a result of this, we also removed the Agentforce: Reset A4D Default Rules command.
- We improved MCP server handling—only servers with modified configurations are reconnected. Servers with unchanged configs stay connected without interruption.
- We removed the History panel to simplify the interface.

# 3.1.0

## Added

- We’re catching good vibes—we’ve rebranded! Agentforce for Developers has leveled up into Agentforce Vibes, because building with agents should feel good. Dev Agent has also been renamed to Agentforce.

## Fixed

- Agentforce now shows the correct error message if you’re not signed into a Salesforce org.

# 3.0.1

- 🚀 Dev Agent GA
